        <p>
          There is a max supply of <strong>10,000</strong> genesis <strong>DEGENS</strong> minted on Ethereum mainnet,{' '}
          <strong>9,897</strong> of which were hand-created by members of our community based on available traits and
          accessories. The initial <strong>3</strong> slots were reserved for our core team members to mint their
          personal <strong>DEGENS</strong> and be able to join in on our games. The final <strong>100</strong> spots are
          set aside to mint special <strong>DEGENS</strong> that will be given away for free as future community
          incentives from the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong>!
        </p>
        <Title level={3}>Future Character Sales</Title>
        <p>
          As our platform continues to grow, we'll aim for partnerships with other popular NFT projects to increase the
          player capacity for our games which are only available to <strong>DEGEN</strong> holders (...if you're reading
          this BAYC{' '}

          ). Another option is to monitor demand and make a decision whether to expand to another EVM-compatible
          blockchain to onboard new users and enable cross-chain gaming. This may also become a requirement if we
          introduce games which require frequent user transactions. If so, <strong>60%</strong> of all proceeds from
          future character sales will be sent to the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong> with the remainder going to our team for
          putting the infrastructure in place and preparing new contracts and characters for the new blockchain(s). and
          current Ethereum <strong>DEGEN</strong> holders should expect a free NFT on the new blockchain(s).
        </p>
        <p>
          It is important to note that the unique trait combinations from our genesis <strong>DEGENS</strong> will{' '}
          <strong>
            <em>never</em>
          </strong>{' '}
          be mintable again and any new generation of characters will either be designed with a unique twist on the
          original tribes, or completely new tribes and traits altogether. While all Nifty League NFTs will have the
          chance to earn daily rewards by playing our games and contributing to the community, only Ethereum{' '}
          <strong>DEGEN</strong> holders will earn daily <strong>NFTL</strong> tokens for the{' '}

          The first step in designing your own <strong>DEGEN</strong> is deciding on 1 of the{' '}

          naturally gravitate towards certain characters based on their personal preferences as gameplay and special
          moves may be quite different between them for certain games. You‚Äôll be able to select which of your characters

          on your friends as you can! <strong>Nifty Smashers</strong> takes inspiration from the classic Super Smash
          Bros game where the objective is to knock your opponents off the map to score points. In order to play you'll
          need a <strong>DEGEN</strong> to select for battle, and then use your keyboard, Playstation or Xbox controller
          as input (couch multiplayer works too!). From the game lobby you'll be able to select from any of your
          previously minted <strong>DEGENs</strong> you own in your wallet to show off your cool creations! Each tribe
          has a unique special move so experiment with different tribes and find the moveset that suits your playstyle
          best. Hold down the attack button for a charged-up bat attack, some special moves can also be charged. When
          you bonk another player, they‚Äôre worth 1 point. The more they‚Äôre successively bonked, the faster they bounce
          around and the more points they‚Äôre worth. Land the final mega-bonk to hit them off the map and claim all the
          points!

          As we are getting ready to launch the online multiplayer in a few weeks, let's talk about lag in fast-paced
          and snappy brawler games like <strong>Nifty Smashers</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally speaking, lag is always present whenever there is physical distance between the players on the
          internet. The greater the distance, the greater the lag. There are different techniques &amp; tricks that
          developers use to compensate and hide the lag. We have implemented a number of these lag compensation
          techniques that veil the lag for the best experience possible. We have also incorporated solutions with
          servers all around the world so that we can match players closest to each other to minimize the lag as much as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, considering the level of responsiveness fast-paced brawlers require{' '}
          <span role="img" aria-label="cloud emoji">
            ‚ö°
          </span>
          , we are expecting some lag when we launch the online multiplayer.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are excited to share our progress with you as soon as possible. Following the launch, with your feedback,
          we will do everything in our power to make the lag as unnoticeable as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>NFTL</strong> acts as a way to decentralize our ecosystem by ensuring important decisions regarding
          the direction of Nifty League are decided via the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong>. The sale of our characters
          kicked off the initial distribution of our ecosystem‚Äôs native utility and governance token;{' '}
          <strong>NFTL</strong>. <strong>NFTL</strong> serves a dual purpose of giving users voting rights on upcoming
          games and tournaments as well as being used for platform-wide expenses. For now, this only includes naming
          characters, but may be expanded to be used for purchasing additional in-game items, collectibles or even
          potential future characters. Any <strong>NFTL</strong> used for naming characters is immediately burned or
          removed from circulation. If and when additional in-game items are introduced, <strong>90%</strong> of all
          proceeds will be given to the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong> with the remaining <strong>10%</strong> paid to our
          team.

        <Title level={3}>Distribution (First Year)</Title>
        <p>
          There is no max supply set for now but we expect around <strong>1 Billion NFTL</strong> to be distributed over
          the next year according to the allocations set below:

          We have decided to close our AXS holders airdrop early to reward our <strong>DEGEN</strong> holders instead
          with <strong>212.85M NFTL</strong> tokens in total; a portion being claimable along with the purchase of{' '}
          <strong>DEGEN</strong> NFTs and the rest airdropped to holders prior to the sale based on a snapshot taken at
          <strong>
            <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://etherscan.io/block/13358250">
              Block #13358250
            </a>
          </strong>
          . While the AXS airdrop contract was open, a total of <strong>256K NFTL</strong> was claimed.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>100M NFTL</strong> was allocated for a team development fund which is time-locked for{' '}
          <strong>6 months</strong> from{' '}

          to support early community plans such as liquidity incentives, tournament rewards, or giveaways. This brings
          the initial supply to around <strong>420M</strong> with daily emissions for all genesis NFT owners starting
          immediately after each character sale.
        </p>
        <Title level={3}>Emissions</Title>
        <p>
          <strong>250M NFTL</strong> will be distributed annually over the first <strong>3 years</strong> to all genesis{' '}
          <strong>DEGEN</strong> NFT owners. There is no need to stake your NFT; just sit back and watch your{' '}
          <strong>NFTL</strong> accrue daily which you can claim on our website at any time on your{' '}
          <Link to="/wallet">wallet page</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any remaining future emissions will either be for daily in-game rewards or funding for the{' '}
          <strong>Nifty DAO</strong>. We will grant the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong> the ability to mint up to{' '}
          <strong>330M NFTL</strong> over the first year after we get a minimum of <strong>7 signers</strong>{' '}
          controlling the multi-sig wallet. We foresee most of these tokens going to community contributors as well as
          being used for competition rewards, but ultimately the DAO will make that decision when the time comes.

        <Title level={2}>Future Developments</Title>
        <p>
          Along with additional games, we have several ideas in store to continue to grow our platform. As a
          forewarning, this is by no means a promise to deliver on features mentioned hereafter if our focuses turn
          towards other aspects of Nifty League‚Äôs ecosystem. For now, one of our main goals is to launch or partner with
          an NFT marketplace allowing you to collect reusable NFTs such as cars or special weapons for our games. These
          smart contracts would extend the ERC-1155 Ethereum multi-token standard to create non-fungible items with a
          set limit on availability for each. As a bonus for playing our games, we would like to award items purchasable
          here to players who can then sell them or use them in-game. Another option we are considering is awarding
          time-released NFTs such as treasure chests which can be burned, revealing the collectible inside. Last but not
          least - rentable characters?? Let's see what the DAO decides!
