          Welcome to the Nifty League! Our mission is to create an interactive and community-governed NFT gaming
          platform. Nifty League prides itself on being one of the first platforms offering competitive games utilizing
          customizable characters and tradable in-game assets.

          Users design, mint, and play as their personal character(s) to compete and earn rewards within our community
          including our ecosystem's token; <strong>NFTL</strong>. Purchasing an Ethereum character not only provides you
          with <strong>NFTL</strong> tokens, but unlocks multiplayer modes within our games granting you admission to
          public tournaments. We strive to make our games highly competitive and packed full of nostalgia from the
          halcyon days of retro gaming! At launch we‚Äôll release our first game{' '}

          several game options that we‚Äôll develop based on community input.

        <Title level={3}>Nifty DAO</Title>
        <p>
          We will gradually be transferring ownership of the Nifty League to our DAO in order to decentralize the
          platform and encourage devs to help us build! <strong>NFTL</strong> is our native governance token which
          provides voting rights and other other utilities (more info <a href="about#nftl">below</a>). Our treasury
          assets are held within a Gnosis multi-sig wallet which will be used to handle distributions to future project
          contributors as well as tournaments and other activities. We plan on migrating everything over to{' '}
          <strong>Arbitrum</strong> once their Gnosis integration is complete to benefit from lower fees going forward.
          We are actively looking for notable members of our community to join our DAO board of members and help control
          the multi-sig wallet so get in touch if you think you would be a good fit!

        <Title level={2}>DEGENS</Title>
        <Title level={3}>Overview</Title>
        <p>
          There will be a max supply of <strong>10,000</strong> genesis <strong>DEGENS</strong> minted on Ethereum
          mainnet, <strong>9,897</strong> of which are hand-created by members of our community based on available
          traits and accessories. The initial <strong>3</strong> slots are reserved for our core team members to mint
          their personal <strong>DEGENS</strong> and be able to join in on our games. As soon as the{' '}
          <strong>3rd DEGEN</strong> is minted the public offering will officially start! The final <strong>100</strong>{' '}
          spots are set aside to mint special <strong>DEGENS</strong> that will be given away for free as future
          community incentives from the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong>!
        </p>
        <Title level={3}>Future Character Sales</Title>
        <p>
          As our platform continues to grow, we'll aim for partnerships with other popular NFT projects to increase the
          player capacity for our games which are only available to <strong>DEGEN</strong> holders (...if you're reading
          this BAYC{' '}

          ). Another option is to monitor demand and make a decision whether to expand to another EVM-compatible
          blockchain to onboard new users and enable cross-chain gaming. This may also become a requirement if we
          introduce games which require frequent user transactions. If so, <strong>50%</strong> of all proceeds from
          future character sales will be sent to the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong> and current Ethereum{' '}
          <strong>DEGEN</strong> holders should expect a free NFT on the new blockchain. It is important to note that
          the unique trait combinations from our genesis <strong>DEGENS</strong> will never be mintable again and any
          new generation of characters will either be designed with a unique twist on the original tribes, or completely
          new tribes and traits altogether. While all Nifty League NFTs will have the chance to earn daily rewards by
          playing our games and contributing to the community, only Ethereum <strong>DEGEN</strong> holders will earn
          daily <strong>NFTL</strong> tokens for the <strong>first 3 years</strong> as described in our token emissions{' '}

          naturally gravitate towards certain characters based on their personal preferences as gameplay and special
          moves may be quite different between them for certain games. You‚Äôll be able to select which of your characters
          to use before each game (so no harm in having one of each tribe!){' '}

          on your friends as you can! <strong>Nifty Smashers</strong> takes inspiration from the classic Super Smash
          Bros game where the objective is to knock your opponents off the map to score points. In order to play you'll
          need a <strong>DEGEN</strong> to select for battle, and then use your keyboard, Playstation or Xbox controller
          as input (couch multiplayer works too!). From the game lobby you'll be able to select from any of your
          previously minted <strong>DEGENs</strong> you own in your wallet to show off your cool creations! Each tribe
          has a unique special move so experiment with different tribes and find the moveset that suits your playstyle
          best. Hold down the attack button for a charged-up bat attack, some special moves can also be charged. When
          you bonk another player, they‚Äôre worth 1 point. The more they‚Äôre successively bonked, the faster they bounce
          around and the more points they‚Äôre worth. Land the final mega-bonk to hit them off the map and claim all the
          points!

          <strong>NFTL</strong> acts as a way to decentralize our ecosystem by ensuring important decisions regarding
          the direction of Nifty League are decided via the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong>. The sale of our characters will
          coincide with the initial distribution of our ecosystem‚Äôs native utility and governance token;{' '}
          <strong>NFTL</strong>. <strong>NFTL</strong> serves a dual purpose of giving users voting rights on upcoming
          games and tournaments as well as being used for platform-wide expenses. For now, this only includes naming
          characters, but may be expanded to be used for purchasing additional in-game items, collectibles or even
          potential future characters. Any <strong>NFTL</strong> used for naming characters is immediately burned or
          removed from circulation. If and when additional in-game items are introduced, <strong>90%</strong> of all
          proceeds will be given to the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong> with the remaining <strong>10%</strong> paid to our
          team.

          <strong>Nifty DAO</strong> for initial funding and future community incentives such as tournament rewards or
          giveaways. This brings the initial supply to <strong>420M</strong> with daily emissions for all genesis NFT
          owners starting immediately after each character sale.

        <Title level={3}>Emissions</Title>
        <p>
          <strong>250M NFTL</strong> will be distributed annually over the first <strong>3 years</strong> to all genesis{' '}
          <strong>DEGEN</strong> NFT owners. There is no need to stake your NFT; just sit back and watch your{' '}
          <strong>NFTL</strong> accrue daily which you can claim on our website at any time on your{' '}
          <Link to="/wallet">wallet page</Link>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any remaining future emissions will either be for daily in-game rewards or funding for the{' '}
          <strong>Nifty DAO</strong>. We will grant the <strong>Nifty DAO</strong> the ability to mint up to{' '}
          <strong>330M NFTL</strong> over the first year after we get a minimum of <strong>10 signers</strong>{' '}
          controlling the multi-sig wallet. We foresee most of these tokens going to community contributors as well as
          being used for competition rewards, but ultimately the DAO will make that decision when the time comes.

          Along with additional games, we have several ideas in store to continue to grow our platform. As a
          forewarning, this is by no means a promise to deliver on features mentioned hereafter if our focuses turn
          towards other aspects of Nifty League‚Äôs ecosystem. For now, one of our main goals is to launch or partner with
          an NFT marketplace allowing you to collect reusable NFTs such as cars or special weapons for our games. These
          smart contracts would extend the ERC-1155 Ethereum multi-token standard to create non-fungible items with a
          set limit on availability for each. As a bonus for playing our games, we would like to award items purchasable
          here to players who can then sell them or use them in-game. Another option we are considering is awarding
          time-released NFTs such as treasure chests which can be burned, revealing the collectible inside. Last but not
          least - rentable characters?? Let's see what the DAO decides!
