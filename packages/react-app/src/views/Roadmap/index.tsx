                  We will gradually be transferring ownership of the Nifty League to our DAO in order to decentralize

                  through community contributions, enabling us to build a gaming platform like no other. Simply put,
                  DAOs are the future. We see only one route to becoming the world's leading GameFi platform and that‚Äôs

                <p>
                  Welcome to the NiftyVerse; a world filled with DEGENS and NFT communities alike with a shared vision
                  to have fun and build a thriving gaming community. What makes the NiftyVerse stand apart from other
                  metaverses is our p2e games being the centerpiece. Walk into our arcade room filled with fun
                  mini-games or venture to destinations on the map to jump into our classic titles like Nifty Smashers
                  and Nifty Kart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The world is centered around a city reminiscent of our popular Sushiswap level in Nifty Smashers. To
                  kick things off we will hold a land sale with premium options in the city as well as cheaper
                  undeveloped land outside the city limits. Acquiring premium land in the city where all the action is
                  comes with the additional benefit of having buildings already in place that you can design however you
                  see fit.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you're a creative type, don't miss this opportunity - we will have an asset store for you to design
                  assets such as buildings or trees and list them for sale based on your defined limits and pricing. Do
                  you want a cool DEGEN theme park or Cyber Kongz meetup? Build out the NiftyVerse to whatever your
                  heart desires!
